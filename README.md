# Splurty
This is the first project from [The Firehose Project](www.thefirehoseproject.com).

Designed to get one's feet wet with Rails, this project randomly shows a quote from a database, and allows any viewer to submit their own.

A [working version](https://firehose-splurty-jim-lin.herokuapp.com/) is hosted on Heroku.
